COVIDsim

Simulation study of vaccine allocation in Hungary

The task was, on the one hand, the creation of a model which, taking into account the available real data, should be able to describe the vaccination pattern in Hungary, and on the other hand, the simulation and evaluation of other possible allocation mechanisms.
Creation of a simulation environment in which the process of vaccine allocation can be studied for various inputs and parameters. Inputs and parameters of the model: The number and vaccination capacity of the districts, the number and preferences of individuals to be vaccinated in the districts, the vaccine doses arriving in the districts at given times, and the way they are distributed.

Executing program

To execute the program, it is worth reading the documentation, because it is well documented.

Basically, you should start here:
The central class is COVIDsim.py, here you can set the simulation you want to run based on the documentation
In Constants.py, choose a config or create your own based on the documentation
Choose which type of simulation you want to run: we want to randomly choose a vaccine for the next person or we want to choose one based on their preferences
```
